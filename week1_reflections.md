# Week One Python reflections
## Key takeaway points: 
#### **Even if Python is high-level language**, it is still quite **formal in its syntax**. While I seem to be fine with grasping the concepts and major creative principles, I'm very slow with building the basic blocks of code. I think  **lots of practice** and class interaction will provide **major support** and **ecouragement**
#### **Refreshing my formal logic** and **math** skills, such as *binary system* and *modulo operations* also seem a great confidence-building tool.
#### Finally, I need to learn how to adjust to the class format. I need to **manage to navigate between** my Python Notebook, while inputting the code along with instructions, and Zoom window, whenever I attend from home. I will try to make it to campus for at least half of the sessions.
